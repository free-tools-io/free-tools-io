    "name": "RC4Drop Encrypt / Decrypt",
    "description": "Simple tool to encrypt and decrypt using RC4Drop. It was discovered that the first few bytes of keystream are strongly non-random and leak information about the key. We can defend against this attack by discarding the initial portion of the keystream. This modified algorithm is traditionally called RC4-drop. By default, 192 words (768 bytes) are dropped by this tool.",

    "description": "Simple tool sha3 (512, 384, 256, 224) strings for the text content online. SHA-3 is the winner of a five-year competition to select a new cryptographic hash algorithm where 64 competing designs were evaluated. Each of the SHA-3 functions is based on an instance of the Keccak algorithm, which NIST selected as the winner of the SHA-3 competition, but those SHA-3 functions won't produce hashes identical to Keccak.",
